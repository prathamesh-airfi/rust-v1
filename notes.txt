  - A collection type is one that can hold multiple values. Arrays, tuples and strings are collection types.
  - A slice is reference to the portion/sequence of a collection type. Its subcategory of references.
  - A string slice is a reference to a sequence of characters from a string.
  - An array slice is a reference to a sequence of elements from an array.
  - As a reference, slice doesn't take ownership of collection. 
  
  
Slice Example
    . String Slice 
    
        fn get_str_len(text: &str) -> usize {
            text.len()
        }
        
    . Array Slice
    
        fn get_arr_len(arr: &[i32]) -> usize {
            arr.len()
        }
