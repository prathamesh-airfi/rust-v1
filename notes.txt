* Struct *

  1. Rust has 3 types of structs
    - Named Field struct
    - Tuple-Like struct
    - Unit-Like struct


* Methods with multiple parameters *
fn is_longer_than(&self, other: &Self) {
  self.duration_secs > other.duration_secs
}

* Associated Function *
  - Associated functions are functions that are attached to a type.
  - A Constructor is a function that returns a new instance of a type.


* Tuple Struct *
  - A tuple is a struct that assigns each piece of data an order in line rather than a name.
  - 
    struct ShortDuration(u32, u32);

* Unit like struct *
  - A unit is an empty tuple, a tuple without values
  -
    struct EmptyStruct;
