** Enums (Enumeration) **

An enum is a type that represents a set of possible values. Each possible value is called as variant.

Syntax:

    enum CardSuit {
      Hearts,
      Diamonds,
      Spades,
      Clubs
    }

    let first_card = CardSuit::Hearts;


    struct Credentials {
        username: String,
        password: String,
    }

    enum PaymentMethodType {
        CreditCard(String),
        DebitCard(String),
        PayPal(Credentials),
    }
